# Calculating Maintenance Calories

The most widely accepted and currently recommended formula for calculating maintenance calories is the **Mifflin-St Jeor
Equation**, so it is what Munchy uses.

### 1. Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

This step estimates the energy required for basic physiological functions (breathing, circulation, etc.) while at
complete rest. The formula requires weight in kilograms ($$W$$), height in centimeters ($$H$$), and age in years
($$A$$).

**For Men:** $$ BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5 $$

**For Women:** $$ BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161 $$

### 2. Apply Activity Multiplier

To find your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)—which equates to your maintenance calories—multiply your BMR by the
factor that best matches your activity level.

| Activity Level        | Description                            | Multiplier             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Sedentary**         | Desk job, little to no exercise        | $$ BMR \times 1.2 $$   |
| **Lightly Active**    | Light exercise/sports 1–3 days/week    | $$ BMR \times 1.375 $$ |
| **Moderately Active** | Moderate exercise/sports 3–5 days/week | $$ BMR \times 1.55 $$  |
| **Very Active**       | Hard exercise/sports 6–7 days/week     | $$ BMR \times 1.725 $$ |
| **Extra Active**      | Very hard exercise/physical job        | $$ BMR \times 1.9 $$   |
